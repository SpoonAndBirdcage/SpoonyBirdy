info: -Spoon And Birdcage is the portfolio of Barrett A. Long. I hold a Masters of Fine Art's Degree from the prestigious Alfred University in New York but the Canadian prairies will always be where I hang my hat. I am currently working as a freelance Web Designer/Developer while working towards a diploma in Computer Software Development. Once I have that I will possess all the skills I need to take over the INTERNET. In all seriousness I want to thank you so much for checking out my portfolio. You are Awesome!
about-me: Lets see. I am the super proud owner of a Boston Terrier named Jacques-Yves. I have degrees in both Print Media and Electronic Integrated Art (which is a fancy name for digital media). I am passionate about design and love the creative problem solving that come with development. Also I'm a Taurus.
about-site: Spoon And Birdcage was built from the ground up to be fast, responsive and easy to maintain. With that in-mind I decided to go with Jekyll to compile a static site, SASS to maximize my CSS fun, Bourbon and Neat for a super lightweight framework, grunt for a task runner and the whole thing is being hosted through GitHub.
