outline: "<p>A Youth Wasted was a small art blog I started to document my progress through art school. Little did I know when I started the site art school would end up taking 6 years to complete (4 years undergraduate work and then 2 years post-graduate). The tech running the site was a custom wordpress theme (build by yours truly) with a custom plug-ins I wrote to make working with art based post types easier.</p>"
musings: "<p>Building this site form scratch using wordpress was how I cut my teeth on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. It was not merely a place to send blog posts into the ether that is the Internet. It was also a fantastic playground to learn web development and design. The site first launched in 2010 and I must have fully redone the site 5 times before I shuttered it earlier this year. I am gonna miss this little guy but with me being done school it was rather symbolic for me to take it off-line.</p>"
