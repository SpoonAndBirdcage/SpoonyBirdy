outline: "<p>On the Homes By Managen project I was hired as a freelance Web Designer/Developer to create a new website for the company. The site they were using at the time was functional but it was not mobile friendly nor did it emphasize the amazing homes that the company builds around Edmonton. Since they were already familiar with the Wordpress admin section (as that is what there old site was running on) it was a no brainier to use it again as a CMS. Being a 30+ year old company they have a pretty entrenched company wide style guide so there were already great logo files, colors and fonts ready for me to use which made my job much easier. All in all it was a pretty straight forward build.</p>
<p>The site has some pretty basic functionality. Creating a main slider and a custom post type for adding new show homes/available homes where the heaviest lifts on the development side of things. As for the design, The idea was to allow the images to be the focus and keep the site aspects very minimal.</p>"
musings: "<p>Working with Managen on this redesign was awesome. Not only did I get to work with one of Edmonton's premiere house builders, but I also got to work with one of my best and oldest friends. Josh Kehler is an amazingly talented photographer and he does all of the photography for Managen, he also happens to be a project supervisor for the company as well (which is how I got the job). Working with him to get all the amazing hero images, detail images and gallery shots was awesome.</p>"
